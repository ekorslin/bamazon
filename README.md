## __Project Summary__

    Overall, this project allows multiple stakeholders invovled with our online company to access and communicate with the back-end MySQL database dependent upon specific objectives they set out to accomplish related to items sold through our online store.  Customers can place orders after viewing available items and their accompanying stock levels, company managers can add inventory to the same list of items or even add new items put up for sale, and supervisors can view summary reporting related to sales numbers by department.
  
  ### __1. Customer Shopping Portal

    As the below screen shows, a customer is presented with an exahaustive list of all available items for sale through our online store upon visit to the site.  The interface prompts the user to key in the item id for which they have interest.
